## Introduction

Websites built with Static Site Generator (SSG) are faster, more secure, and dev-friendly.
They are also easier for SEO.
It can be difficult to choose a suitable SSG because there are many.
However, Hugo and Jekyll are the most popular choices among developers.

Let's compare Hugo with Jekyll, shall we?

## Comparison

### Ease of Install

- If you are a MacOS or Linux user, you can install Hugo with a single command.
  For instructions about how to install Hugo on other operating systems, follow the official [installation guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing).

  - Command for MacOS:
    `brew install hugo`

  - Command for Linux (Ubuntu):
    `sudo apt install hugo`

- Installing Jekyll is not as straight forward as installing Hugo.
  However, there is an excellent [installation guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to get started with Jekyll.

### External Dependencies

- Unlike many other static site generators, Hugo does not require any external dependencies to run.
  All you need is the Hugo binary.

- Jekyll, on the other hand depends on Ruby.
  So, Ruby needs to be configured first in order to install Jekyll.

### Speed

- Hugo is currently the fastest static site generator in the market.
  It can generate thousands of webpages in just a few seconds.
  That saves a lot of time when your site starts growing in size.

- Jekyll is at least 3 times slower than Hugo.
  That means Jekyll needs significantly more time than Hugo to build the same site.

### Flexibility

- Hugo is very flexible in terms of content structure.
  It can be used to build various types of websites.
  For example, Blog, Documentation, Portfolio, and many others.

- On the other hand, Jekyll is primarily recognized for its built-in features that facilitate the creation of comprehensive blogs.
  Additional functionalities can be integrated through various third-party plugins.

### Theme Availability

- Hugo offers a wide range of themes that are straightforward to customize.
  This aspect of Hugo themes allows developers to modify layouts, styles, and functionalities without extensive coding.

- Jekyll also has a rich selection of themes, particularly for blogs.
  However, the customization of themes can sometimes be more complex due to the reliance on Ruby and plugins.

## Conclusion

Both Hugo and Jekyll present comparable features, making the decision between the two a challenging one.
The choice is largely dependent on the specific needs and project requirements.
As you may have noticed, I chose to build this website with Hugo.
