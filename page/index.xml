&lt;p>Hello! I go by the name ArcaneSavant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My goal is to learn as much as I can about technology, with an emphasis on Free and Open Source Software (FOSS).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I spent my childhood living in rural Bangladesh and have now moved to urban areas.
I completed my undergraduate studies with a degree in Forestry from a top university in Bangladesh.
At present, I am studying for a Master&amp;rsquo;s in Environmental Science.
These experiences fuel my interest in the relationship between technology and the environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On top of my interests in technology, I enjoy going on long walks with family and friends to take in the scenery as well as share important stories about life.
After all, technology ought to go hand in hand with nature.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You might ask, Why did I write this blog in the first place?
The truth is, I wanted to join the remarkable works of others I found on the internet.
I want to be a part of that community and help out people who share the same passion but find the tech world rather intimidating.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Come along while we delve into the realm of technology, and do not hesitate to express your opinions along the way!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Archives</title><link>https://arcanesavant.github.io/archives/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://arcanesavant.github.io/archives/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Search</title><link>https://arcanesavant.github.io/search/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://arcanesavant.github.io/search/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
